# Spam-Or-Ham-Email-Classifier-Using-Logistic-Regression
## Overview
Using scikit learn, I was able to develop a machine learning model that classified emails into two categories. First, I had to preprocess the dataset so that it was in a format that the model could be trained on. Then, I selected the appropriate classifier for the task at hand. Then, I analyzed a variety of statistics to see how well the model performed. Finally, I looked under the cover of the machine learning model to see what it had learned.
